# dbger.c
This is a toy project because I wanted to learn how debuggers and disassembler work.

## dbger.c
The debugger is in a very raw state right now, only intended for x86_64, not meant to be actaully used. Still work in progress.

### Building
```sh
make
```

## disasm.c
More info in [disasm dir](./disasm/).
